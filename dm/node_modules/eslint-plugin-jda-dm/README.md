ESLint-plugin-JDA
===================

JDA specific linting rules for ESLint

# Installation

Install [ESLint](https://www.github.com/eslint/eslint) either locally or globally.

    npm install eslint

Because the plug in is included within the WM repo, it shouldn't need to be installed globally.
Eslint should pick it up automatically.

# Configuration

Add the `plugins` section to the .eslintrc file and specify the JDA plugin, omitting the eslint-plugin prefix.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["jda-dm"]
}
```


Finally, enable the rules that you would like to use. The rules for this plugin need to be prefixed with "jda-dm/".

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "jda-dm/rpux-deprecations": 1,
    "jda-dm/rp-deprecations": 1,
  }
}
```

# List of supported rules

* [rp-deprecations](docs/rules/rpux-deprecations.md): Prevents usage of deprecated RP classes and xtypes.
* [rpux-deprecations](docs/rules/rp-deprecations.md): Prevents usage of deprecated RPUX classes and xtypes.
